## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

docker run -d -p 4445:4444 selenium/standalone-chrome -role hub
## Conection and Packages
```{r pacakges}
library(RSelenium)
library(rvest)
library(xml2)
library(tidyverse)
remDR <- RSelenium::remoteDriver (remoteServerAddr = "localhost",
                     port = 4444L,
                     browserName = "firefox")
remDR$open()
remDR <- remDR[["cleint"]]
remDR$navigate("https://www.google.com")





```


```{r pacakges}

remDr$closeServer()
```


```{r pacakges}
```

##

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
